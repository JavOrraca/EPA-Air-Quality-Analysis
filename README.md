For our team project, below our proposed analysis:

* **Dataset**: US Historical Air Quality data from the EPA (338 GB and continuously updated), accessible via BigQuery
  * Source: [Air Quality Data Collected at Outdoor Monitors Across the US](https://www.kaggle.com/epa/epa-historical-air-quality)
<br>
* **Deliverables**: Interactive dashboard (via Dash or Bokeh) of a US map, showing how air quality has changed from 1950 to current date
<br>
* **Project**:
  * Analyze air quality summary statistics by year at the US county level
  * If time permits, build a neural network via TensorFlow or PyTorch, using a pipeline created in Spark / Databricks, and made available through an interactive dashboard
<br>
* **Research Questions**:
  * How US air quality changes through time at the county level;
  * What factors could cause these changes (potentially researching external data sets for understanding "why" US air quality got better or worse, etc.)
